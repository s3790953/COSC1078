            </br>
            <p>• At first, one of the most basic features of the “Hogwarts battle” is introduction class which will instruct players to figure out</p>
            <p>game’s fundamental rules involving techniques, items, game modes, basic setting. Moreover, the shop of this game will contain several</p>

            <p>statistics or functions of each item, games will be divided into three main types, for instance, normal players can play game in</p>
            <p>order to have fun and gain XP and IP, single ranking affect personal ranking points deciding classes achieved by players, for</p>
            <p>example, learners, interns, masters, experts, group ranking system is the same as single ranking system however the points are</p>

            <p>players have to collect XP through playing normal games, winning expeditions or completing required missions. In addition, players</p>
            <p>can choose their communicating method in game by talking through micros or using chatting box. </p>
            </br>
            <p>• There will be some necessary sources required to establish the “Hogwarts battle” such as software and open resource tools like</p>
            <p>Unity is used as a cross-platform engine which is the main equipment to develop the game involving general gaming editing, GitMerge</p>
            <p>is necessary to merge scene, merge a prefab and active development, Blender responsible for creating animated films, visual effects,</p>
            <p>art, 3D printed models, interactive 3D applications, rigging, applying shaders, Fraps being a benchmarking, screen capture and screen</p>
            <p>recording will support graphic representation, FMOD is a sound effect engine that play and mix sounds of diverse formats, OBS is a</p>
            <p>open-source cross-platform streaming and recording program assisting beta videos. Computers with good specs for high-end gaming, then</p>
            <p>beef up the CPU and graphics card, big hard drive and lots of RAM (>8GB) are going to be essential.</p>
            </br>
            <p>• This game requires developers with in-depth knowledges of AI, graphic, sound, network communications, input processing, game art</p>
            <p>design, Scripting, programming language such as C++, Java, C#, and communicating skills, level of team work, creativities are also</p>
            <p>taking important roles. Besides, pre-production, pitches, prototypes, and game design documents must be written and some equipment</p>
            <p>involving recording audio, animations are necessary. I need to spend more time on searching for references of computer science and</p>
            <p>studying from other experts such as RMIT professors, so I could be equipped with essential qualifications, and I must improve my</p>
            <p>communication, teamwork level through group projects, clubs, social activities. Then I might write essential software depend on my</p>
            <p>knowledge and help from the team, I can use available devices such as smartphone or buy secondhand cameras to record essential</p>
            <p>documents before I afford professional hardware.</p>
            </br>
            <p>• If the project is successful it would create the multicultural environment for online gamers, appealing entertainment, attractive</p>
            <p>online 3D game offer players with several interesting experience and opportunities for striking relationships, effective method of</p>
            <p>earning a living. "Hogwarts battle” with methodical development will be expected to attract sponsors’ investment in order to deal</p>
            <p>with lack of equipment and the flexible ways of advertisement, the team will put more efforts on not only creations of outstanding</p>
            <p>features in order to compete with other competitors but also on achievements of experience , knowledge, individuals having the same</p>
            <p>passion could apply for the team and contribute their abilities to the development of “Hogwarts battle”. This development could</p>
